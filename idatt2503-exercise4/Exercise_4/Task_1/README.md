## How to run the code?
In the ‘scripts’ folder, you’ll find two scripts: one for compiling the code and another for running the program. The scripts are named ‘compile.sh’ and ‘run.sh,’ making their functions clear. ‘compile.sh’ is used to build the program, and ‘run.sh’ is used to execute it.

## Verify that the program prints to standard error
If you inspect the ‘run.sh’ script, you’ll notice that the standard output is redirected to /dev/null. This means that if any output appears on the command line, it must be coming from standard error. To test this, you can try redirecting the standard error to /dev/null instead, and you’ll observe that no output from the program will be displayed.

## Verify that the program returns an error code
The exit code of the program is displayed by the ‘run.sh’ script. This exit code is printed using an ‘echo’ command after the program finishes running. It’s important to note that this exit code is separate from the program’s actual output since it is generated by the script after the program has already terminated.
